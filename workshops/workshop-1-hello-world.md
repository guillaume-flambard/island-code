## What We're Building

A simple personal webpage that says "Hello Koh Phangan" and tells people a little about you.

---

## Step 1: Set Up Your Workspace

1. Open a text editor (like Notepad on Windows, TextEdit on Mac, or VS Code)
2. Create a new file called `index.html`
3. Save it in a folder called `my-first-website`

## Step 2: Write Your First HTML

Copy this code into your `index.html` file:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Hello Koh Phangan!</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Hello Koh Phangan!</h1>
    <p>My name is [Your Name]</p>
    <p>I am learning to build websites!</p>
    <p>This is my first webpage.</p>
</body>
</html>
```

**What to do:**
- Replace `[Your Name]` with your actual name
- Feel free to add more sentences about yourself

## Step 3: View Your Website

1. Find your `index.html` file in the folder
2. Double-click it (or right-click and choose "Open with" → your web browser)
3. You should see your webpage!

## Step 4: Make It More Personal
