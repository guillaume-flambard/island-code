# Island Code for Locals
Learn to build websites and use AI — for the people of Koh Phangan.

## What is Island Code for Locals?
Island Code for Locals is a community-driven initiative created in Koh Phangan to help local Thai
and Myanmar residents learn the basics of web development and AI tools — for free or by donation.
Our goal is to share digital skills that can empower locals to create websites for small businesses,
personal projects, and future job opportunities — all in a friendly, inclusive, and island-style learning
vibe.
## Why this project?
Koh Phangan is full of creativity, entrepreneurship, and spiritual energy — but access to modern
tech education here is very limited. Many locals speak some English and work with tourists every
day. They are curious, motivated, and ready to learn. This project aims to bridge that gap, by
creating a relaxed space where coding and AI become tools for creativity, independence, and
community connection.
## What do we teach?
All classes are practical, simple, and visual — no theory overload. Each session ends with a real result students can proudly show or use.

**Example Workshops:**
1. Build your first website — 'Hello Koh Phangan' personal webpage
2. Web design basics — Page for a local café or yoga studio
3. Publish your site online — Website live on GitHub Pages
4. Intro to AI tools — Write posts, translate, or design using ChatGPT
5. Local project — Real website for a local shop or business
## Where does it happen?
We’re looking for local partners who can host small sessions (5–10 people) once a week: cafés,
coworking spaces, or community centers. Each session lasts 1.5 to 2 hours, usually in the late
afternoon or early evening.
## How it works
This is a voluntary / donation-based project. No one pays to learn — they contribute what they can.
Possible formats include a donation box on site, local sponsors, or support from digital nomads.
100% of donations go back into materials, laptops, and expanding the program.
## What we offer to partners
If you host or support the project, you get visibility in communication, your venue featured in real
projects, and a meaningful contribution to Koh Phangan’s future.
## Language & Approach
Classes are in simple English, using easy words and visual explanations. Materials can be
translated into Thai and Burmese when needed. We don’t just teach coding — we teach confidence
and curiosity.
